AT&T TDP Technical Assessment

Introduction:
I used Python to accomplish this project. I adopted some of key OOP concepts and datastructures
to calculate the correct output. I created two classes including Author and Book to store all data of
these objects effectively. I also used Datetime library to compare the publication dates of the books.
The authors and their generes are pre built into the program new authors not result in error, however will
be disregarded by the program

Installations:
In order to run this program you will need to install:
- Python
- Python library Datetime

Running the program:
There are two ways to run this program:
1) get to the Author Project AT&T directory in CLI and then type the following command.
   >>python main.py
2) open this project on any python IDE an run the main.py file to start the program.

Input:
After starting, the program will allow you to input multiple books and its information.
feel free to copy and past list of books during runtime input. Once done entering
input enter q to exit

Output:
The program outputs the oldest BOOK by the AUTHOR with the most BOOKS.
